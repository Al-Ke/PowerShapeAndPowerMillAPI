PM projects in this folder should have only been created using the latest PowerMill 2013 version.
Do not save in a later version (PM2014+) of PowerMill otherwise the test cases will fail because PM2013 will not be able to load the project.
If you need to use a later PM version for new functionality testing then create a new folder and put your pm projects in there!!!!
Otherwise you will have to recreate all you old pm projects in the relevant version :(
